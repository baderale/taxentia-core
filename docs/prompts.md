## 🧾 Example Prompt: §195 Startup Deductions

User: Can my client deduct startup expenses if no income was earned this year?  

**Response:**

✅ Yes, but only if an active trade or business began.

🔍 Under IRC §195(a), startup expenditures can be amortized over 180 months. However, §195(c)(1)(A) requires the business to be active before deduction. The absence of income alone is not disqualifying, per Rev. Rul. 99-23.
